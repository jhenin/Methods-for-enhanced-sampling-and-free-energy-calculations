## Paper writing as code development
<!-- This discussion is so that people know how to contribute to your document. -->
This paper is being developed as a living document, open to changes from the community. You can read more about the concept of writing a paper in the same way one would write software code in the essay ["Paper writing as code development"](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/about/paper_code/). If you have comments or suggestions, we welcome them! Please [submit them as issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to this GitHub repository so they can be recorded and given credit for the contribution. Specific changes can be proposed [via pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
