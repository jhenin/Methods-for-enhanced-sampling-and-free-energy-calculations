\begin{frontmatter}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Perpetual Review document.
Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.

In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.
\end{abstract}

\end{frontmatter}




\section{Introduction}

Here you would explain what area you are reviewing, and motivate your review.

In this particular template, we have removed most of the usage examples which occur in \texttt{sample-document.tex} to provide a minimal template you can modify.

Keep in mind, as you prepare your manuscript, that you should plan for a representative image  which will be used to highlight your article on the journal website and publications. Usually, this would be one of your figures, but it must also be uploaded separately upon article submission. We give specific guidelines for this image on the journal website in the section on article submission (see \url{https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/index.html#article-submission}).

Additionally, for well-formatted manuscripts, we recommend that you let LaTeX handle figure/table placement for you as much as possible, so please avoid specifying strenuous float instructions like `[h!]` and `[H]` as much as possible.

\section{Review organization}

In general the organization of your review is up to you.
LiveCoMS reviews are similar to traditional reviews except that they are updatable.

\subsection{Perpetual review}

You will probably want to devote at least a small amount of space explaining to your readers what a Perpetual Review is and highlighting how they can get involved via your git issue tracker or by communicating with you directly.
In contrast to a traditional review, here it \emph{will} help you if the community points out other, related work that perhaps should be cited, since it reduces the need for you to dig deeply into the literature to keep your work up to date.

Tutorials should endeavor to cover the specific task at hand, and also highlight how the steps might need to be modified (or additional care might need to be taken at particular points) to handle more general cases.

The scope of the tutorial, as well as the expected proficiencies / outcomes for researchers who complete the tutorial, should be clearly defined.
This will often happen in a specific section or subsection in the article itself.

\section{Prerequisites}

In keeping with other types of articles at LiveCoMS, it may be useful (at your discretion) to note any prerequisites your article assumes and who it is targeted at.

\section{Conclusions}

It's appropriate to wrap up with discussion and conclusions.
