We suggest a modification to the GROMOS 45a4 parameter set which improves considerably the agreement of simulation results with theoretical and experimental estimates of puckering free energies. We also report on the experimental measurement of altrose conformer populations by means of NMR spectroscopy, which show good agreement with the predictions of current theoretical models.}},

  abstract = {{Metadynamics is an enhanced sampling method designed to flatten free energy surfaces uniformly. However, the highest-energy regions are often irrelevant to study and dangerous to explore because systems often change irreversibly in unforeseen ways in response to driving forces in these regions, spoiling the sampling. Introducing an on-the-fly domain restriction allows metadynamics to flatten only up to a specified energy level and no further, improving efficiency and safety while decreasing the pressure on practitioners to design collective variables that are robust to otherwise irrelevant high energy driving. This paper describes a new method that achieves this using sequential on-the-fly estimation of energy wells and redefinition of the metadynamics hill shape, termed metabasin metadynamics. The energy level may be defined a priori or relative to unknown barrier energies estimated on-the-fly. Altering only the hill ensures that the method is compatible with many other advances in metadynamics methodology. The hill shape has a natural interpretation in terms of multiscale dynamics, and the computational overhead in simulation is minimal when studying systems of any reasonable size, for instance proteins or other macromolecules. Three example applications show that the formula is accurate and robust to complex dynamics, making metadynamics significantly more forgiving with respect to CV quality and thus more feasible to apply to the most challenging biomolecular systems.}},

  abstract = {{A small change in the Hamiltonian scaling in Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST) is found to improve its sampling efficiency greatly, especially for the sampling of aqueous protein solutions in which there are large-scale solute conformation changes. Like the original REST (REST1), the new version (which we call REST2) also bypasses the poor scaling with system size of the standard Temperature Replica Exchange Method (TREM), reducing the number of replicas (parallel processes) from what must be used in TREM. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST2 is compared with TREM and with REST1 for the folding of the trpcage and β-hairpin in water. The comparisons confirm that REST2 greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and greatly increases the sampling efficiency over REST1. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.}},

From a numerical viewpoint, a parallel implementation of these methods is very natural, the replicas interacting through the reconstructed free energy. We demonstrate how to improve this parallel implementation by resorting to some selection mechanism on the replicas. This is illustrated by computations on a model system of conformational changes.},

  abstract = {{Large parallel gains in the development of both computational resources as well as sampling methods have now made it possible to simulate dissociation events in ligand-protein complexes with all--atom resolution. Such encouraging progress, together with the inherent spatiotemporal resolution associated with molecular simulations, has left their use for investigating dissociation processes brimming with potential, both in rational drug design, where it can be an invaluable tool for determining the mechanistic driving forces behind dissociation rate constants, as well as in force-field development, where it can provide a catalog of transient molecular structures on which to refine force-fields. Although much progress has been made in making force-fields more accurate, reducing their error for transient structures along a transition path could yet prove to be a critical development helping to make kinetic predictions much more accurate. In what follows we will provide a state-of-the-art compilation of the enhanced sampling methods based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations used to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of ligand-protein dissociation processes. Due to the timescales of such processes being slower than what is accessible using straightforward MD simulations, several ingenious schemes are being devised at a rapid rate to overcome this obstacle. Here we provide an up-to-date compendium of such methods and their achievements/shortcomings in extracting mechanistic insight into ligand-protein dissociation. We conclude with a critical and provocative appraisal attempting to answer the title of this review.}},

We describe our approach and apply it to the two prototypical systems a SN2 chemical reaction and to the freezing of silica.

This makes it an ideal tool for researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new methods to be immediately available to the larger community.},

  abstract = {{The difference between free energy changes occurring at two chemical states can be rigorously estimated via alchemical free energy (AFE) simulations. Traditionally, most AFE simulations are carried out under the classical energy potential treatment; then, accuracy and applicability of AFE simulations are limited. In the present work, we integrate a recent second-order generalized ensemble strategy, the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) method, into the combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential based AFE simulation scheme. Thereby, within a commonly affordable simulation length, accurate QM/MM alchemical free energy simulations can be achieved. As revealed by the model study on the equilibrium of a tautomerization process of hydrated 3-hydroxypyrazole and by the model calculations of the redox potentials of two flavin derivatives, lumichrome (LC) and riboflavin (RF) in aqueous solution, the present OSRW-based scheme could be a viable path toward the realization of practically efficient QM/MM AFE simulations.}},

  abstract = {We obtain upper bounds on the spectral gap of Markov chains constructed by parallel and simulated tempering, and provide a set of sufficient conditions for torpid mixing of both techniques. Combined with the results of Woodard, Schmidler and Huber (2009), these results yield a two-sided bound on the spectral gap of these algorithms. We identify a persistence property of the target distribution, and show that it can lead unexpectedly to slow mixing that commonly used convergence diagnostics will fail to detect. For a multimodal distribution, the persistence is a measure of how ``spiky'', or tall and narrow, one peak is relative to the other peaks of the distribution. We show that this persistence phenomenon can be used to explain the torpid mixing of parallel and simulated tempering on the ferromagnetic mean-field Potts model shown previously. We also illustrate how it causes torpid mixing of tempering on a mixture of normal distributions with unequal covariances in {R{\textasciicircum}M,} a previously unknown result with relevance to statistical inference problems. More generally, anytime a multimodal distribution includes both very narrow and very wide peaks of comparable probability mass, parallel and simulated tempering are shown to mix slowly.},

This is largely because important transitions, such as conformational changes and (un)binding events, tend to be rare for conventional simulations (<10μs). That is, conventional simulations will predominantly dwell in metastable states instead of making large transitions in complex biomolecular energy landscapes. In contrast, path sampling approaches focus computing effort specifically on transitions of interest. Such approaches have been in use for nearly 20 years in biomolecular systems and enabled the generation of pathways and calculation of rate constants for ms processes, including large protein conformational changes, protein folding, and protein (un)binding.},

This is traditionally done through iterative cycles of simulation and reparameterization. An alternative approach is to bias the potential energy so that the system matches experimental data. This can be done while minimally changing the underlying free energy of the molecular simulation. Current minimal biasing methods require replicas, which can lead to unphysical dynamics and introduces new complexity: the choice of replica number and their properties. Here, we describe a new method, called experiment directed simulation that does not require replicas, converges rapidly, can match many data simultaneously, and minimally modifies the potential. The experiment directed simulation method is demonstrated on model systems and a three-component electrolyte simulation. The theory used to derive the method also provides insight into how changing a molecular force-field impacts the expected value of observables in simulation.}},

We have developed a metadynamics-based approach, named funnel metadynamics, that allows the ligand to enhance the sampling of the target binding sites and its solvated states. This method leads to an efficient characterization of the binding free-energy surface and an accurate calculation of the absolute protein–ligand binding free energy. We illustrate our protocol in two systems, benzamidine/trypsin and SC-558/cyclooxygenase 2. In both cases, the X-ray conformation has been found as the lowest free-energy pose, and the computed protein–ligand binding free energy in good agreement with experiments. Furthermore, funnel metadynamics unveils important information about the binding process, such as the presence of alternative binding modes and the role of waters. The results achieved at an affordable computational cost make funnel metadynamics a valuable method for drug discovery and for dealing with a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and material science.}},

  abstract             = {We develop an efficient sampling and free energy calculation technique within the adaptive biasing potential (ABP) framework. By mollifying the density of states we obtain an approximate free energy and an adaptive bias potential that is computed directly from the population along the coordinates of the free energy. Because of the mollifier, the bias potential is "nonlocal", and its gradient admits a simple analytic expression. A single observation of the reaction coordinate can thus be used to update the approximate free energy at every point within a neighborhood of the observation. This greatly reduces the equilibration time of the adaptive bias potential. This approximation introduces two parameters: strength of mollification and the zero of energy of the bias potential. While we observe that the approximate free energy is a very good estimate of the actual free energy for a large range of mollification strength, we demonstrate that the errors associated with the mollification may be removed via deconvolution. The zero of energy of the bias potential, which is easy to choose, influences the speed of convergence but not the limiting accuracy. This method is simple to apply to free energy or mean force computation in multiple dimensions and does not involve second derivatives of the reaction coordinates, matrix manipulations nor on-the-fly adaptation of parameters. For the alanine dipeptide test case, the new method is found to gain as much as a factor of 10 in efficiency as compared to two basic implementations of the adaptive biasing force methods, and it is shown to be as efficient as well-tempered metadynamics with the postprocess deconvolution giving a clear advantage to the mollified density of states method.},

Originally developed for discrete systems, the algorithm samples configurations according to their inverse density of states using Monte Carlo moves; the estimate for the density of states is refined at each simulation step and is ultimately used to calculate thermodynamic properties. We present an implementation for atomic systems based on a rigorous separation of kinetic and configurational contributions to the density of states. By constructing a “uniform” ensemble for configurational degrees of freedom—in which all potential energies, volumes, and numbers of particles are equally probable—we establish a framework for the correct implementation of simulation acceptance criteria and calculation of thermodynamic averages in the continuum case. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we perform sample calculations for the Lennard-Jones fluid using two implementation variants and in both cases find good agreement with established literature values for the vapor-liquid coexistence locus.}},

  abstract = {{Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand-substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.}},

We illustrate our method on the example of the “biradicality landscapes”, which we explore by introducing the natural orbital occupation numbers (NOONs) as the electronic collective variable driving the dynamics. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on the simulation of p-xylylene and [8]annulene allowing to automatically extract the biradical geometries. In the case of [8]annulene the ASQPM metadynamics leads to the prediction of biradical scaffolds that can be stabilized by a suitable chemical substitution, leading to the design of novel functional molecules exhibiting biradical functionality.}},

  abstract = {{Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code. References [1] S.

  abstract = {{The computational study of conformational transitions in nucleic acids still faces many challenges. For example, in the case of single stranded RNA tetranucleotides, agreement between simulations and experiments is not satisfactory due to inaccuracies in the force fields commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations. We here use experimental data collected from high-resolution X-ray structures to attempt an improvement of the latest version of the AMBER force field. A modified metadynamics algorithm is used to calculate correcting potentials designed to enforce experimental distributions of backbone torsion angles. Replica-exchange simulations of tetranucleotides including these correcting potentials show significantly better agreement with independent solution experiments for the oligonucleotides containing pyrimidine bases. Although the proposed corrections do not seem to be portable to generic RNA systems, the simulations revealed the importance of the α and ζ backbone angles for the modulation of the RNA conformational ensemble. The correction protocol presented here suggests a systematic procedure for force-field refinement.}},

Moreover, MFI naturally extends to aggregate information obtained from independent metadynamics simulations, allowing to converge free energy surfaces without the need to sample recrossing events in a single continuous trajectory. We validate MFI against one- and two-dimensional analytical potentials and by computing the conformational free energy landscape of ibuprofen in the bulk of its most common crystal phase.}},

The accuracy and efficiency of the method are tested for the two-dimensional Ising model (up to size 50×50) by comparison with both exact results and previous studies. This method is a general one and should be applicable to more realistic model systems.}},

  abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) techniques are widely used in computing free energy changes for conformational transitions and chemical reactions, mainly in condensed matter systems. Most of the MD‐based approaches employ biased sampling of a priori selected coarse‐grained coordinates or collective variables (CVs) and thereby accelerate otherwise infrequent transitions from one free energy basin to the other. A quick convergence in free energy estimations can be achieved by enhanced sampling of large number of CVs. Conventional enhanced sampling approaches become exponentially slower with increasing dimensionality of the CV space, and thus they turn out to be highly inefficient in sampling high‐dimensional free energy landscapes. Here, we focus on some of the novel methods that are designed to overcome this limitation. In particular, we discuss four methods: bias‐exchange metadynamics, parallel‐bias metadynamics, adiabatic free energy dynamics/temperature‐accelerated MD, and temperature‐accelerated sliced sampling. The basic idea behind these techniques is presented and applications using these techniques are illustrated. Advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are also delineated. This article is categorized under: Structure and Mechanism > Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis Molecular and Statistical Mechanics > Free Energy Methods Theoretical and Physical Chemistry > Statistical Mechanics Advanced methods to efficiently explore the free energy landscapes of chemical reactions are discussed in this review.}},

  abstract  = {{The characterization of denatured states of proteins is challenging because the lack of permanent structure in these states makes it difficult to apply to them standard methods of structural biology. In this work we use all-atom replica-averaged metadynamics (RAM) simulations with NMR chemical shift restraints to determine an ensemble of structures representing an acid-denatured state of the 86-residue protein ACBP. This approach has enabled us to reach convergence in the free energy landscape calculations, obtaining an ensemble of structures in relatively accurate agreement with independent experimental data used for validation. By observing at atomistic resolution the transient formation of native and non-native structures in this acid-denatured state of ACBP, we rationalize the effects of single-point mutations on the folding rate, stability, and transition-state structures of this protein, thus characterizing the role of the unfolded state in determining the folding process.}},

The nature of these conformations and their relative probabilities are described by a high-dimensional free energy landscape. While computer simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations allow characterisation of the metastable conformational states and the transitions between them, and thus free energy landscapes, to be characterised, the barriers between states can be high, precluding efficient sampling without substantial computational resources. Over the past decades, a dizzying array of methods have emerged for enhancing conformational sampling, and for projecting the free energy landscape onto a reduced set of dimensions that allow conformational states to be distinguished, known as collective variables (CVs), along which sampling may be directed. Here, a brief description of what biomolecular simulation entails is followed by a more detailed exposition of the nature of CVs and methods for determining these, and, lastly, an overview of the myriad different approaches for enhancing conformational sampling, most of which rely upon CVs, including new advances in both CV determination and conformational sampling due to machine learning.}},

  abstract = {{Amid collective-variable (CV)-based importance-sampling algorithms, a hybrid of the extended adaptive biasing force and the well-tempered metadynamics algorithms (WTM-eABF) has proven particularly cost-effective for exploring the rugged free-energy landscapes that underlie biological processes. However, as an inherently CV-based algorithm, this hybrid scheme does not explicitly accelerate sampling in the space orthogonal to the chosen CVs, thereby limiting its efficiency and accuracy, most notably in those cases where the slow degrees of freedom of the process at hand are not accounted for in the model transition coordinate. Here, inspired by Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), we introduce the same CV-independent harmonic boost potential into WTM-eABF, yielding a hybrid algorithm coined GaWTM-eABF. This algorithm leans on WTM-eABF to explore the transition coordinate with a GaMD-mollified potential and recovers the unbiased free-energy landscape through thermodynamic integration followed by proper reweighting. As illustrated in our numerical tests, GaWTM-eABF effectively overcomes the free-energy barriers in orthogonal space and correctly recovers the unbiased potential of mean force (PMF). Furthermore, applying both GaWTM-eABF and WTM-eABF to two biologically relevant processes, namely, the reversible folding of (i) deca-alanine and (ii) chignolin, our results indicate that GaWTM-eABF reduces the uncertainty in the PMF calculation and converges appreciably faster than WTM-eABF. Obviating the need of multiple-copy strategies, GaWTM-eABF is a robust, computationally efficient algorithm to surmount the free-energy barriers in orthogonal space and maps with utmost fidelity the free-energy landscape along selections of CVs. Moreover, our strategy that combines WTM-eABF with GaMD can be easily extended to other biasing-force algorithms.}},

But these calculations are still difficult and tedious to analyze, and best practices for analysis are not well defined or propagated. Essentially, each group analyzing these calculations needs to decide how to conduct the analysis and, usually, develop its own analysis tools. Here, we review and recommend best practices for analysis yielding reliable free energies from molecular simulations. Additionally, we provide a Python tool, alchemical-analysis.py, freely available on GitHub as part of the pymbar package (located at http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar), that implements the analysis practices reviewed here for several reference simulation packages, which can be adapted to handle data from other packages. Both this review and the tool covers analysis of alchemical calculations generally, including free energy estimates via both thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation-based estimators. Our Python tool also handles output from multiple types of free energy calculations, including expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange, as well as standard fixed ensemble calculations. We also survey a range of statistical and graphical ways of assessing the quality of the data and free energy estimates, and provide prototypes of these in our tool. We hope this tool  and discussion will serve as a foundation for more standardization of and agreement on best practices for analysis of free energy calculations.},

Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices--corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables--can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

Since the advent of computers, many scientists have put efforts in developing theoretical models that could decode the alphabet of the LPB interaction. The success of this task passes by the resolution of the molecular mechanism of LPB. In the past century, major attention was dedicated to the thermodynamics of LPB, while more recent studies have revealed that ligand (un)binding kinetics is at least as important as ligand binding thermodynamics in determining the drug in vivo efficacy. In the present review, we introduce the most widely used computational methods to study LPB thermodynamics and kinetics. It is important to say that no method outperforms another, they all have pros and cons and the choice of the user should take carefully into account the system under investigation, the available structural and experimental data, and the goal of the research. A perspective on future directions of method development and research on LPB concludes the discussion.

The method is shown to be highly effective in achieving convergence. An important feature of this method is its ability to attain arbitrary levels of description for the free energy. It is thus ideally suited to in silico measurement of elastic moduli and other material properties related to free energy perturbations. We demonstrate the utility of such applications by applying our method to calculate the Frank elastic constants of the Lebwohl–Lasher model of liquid crystals.}},

The resulting bias potential effectively accelerates transitions between metastable free energy minima while ensuring bias-free transition states, thus allowing accurate kinetic rates to be obtained. We test the method on a few illustrative systems for which we obtain an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency relative to previous approaches and several orders of magnitude relative to unbiased molecular dynamics. We expect an even larger improvement in more complex systems. This and the ability of the variational approach to deal efficiently with a large number of collective variables will greatly enhance the scope of these calculations.

  abstract = {{Methods that combine collective variable (CV) based enhanced sampling and global tempering approaches are used in speeding‐up the conformational sampling and free energy calculation of large and soft systems with a plethora of energy minima. In this paper, a new method of this kind is proposed in which the well‐sliced metadynamics approach (WSMTD) is united with replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) method. WSMTD employs a divide‐and‐conquer strategy wherein high‐dimensional slices of a free energy surface are independently sampled and combined. The method enables one to accomplish a controlled exploration of the CV‐space with a restraining bias as in umbrella sampling, and enhance‐sampling of one or more orthogonal CVs using a metadynamics like bias. The new hybrid method proposed here enables boosting the sampling of more slow degrees of freedom in WSMTD simulations, without the need to specify associated CVs, through a replica exchange scheme within the framework of REST2. The high‐dimensional slices of the probability distributions of CVs computed from the united WSMTD and REST2 simulations are subsequently combined using the weighted histogram analysis method to obtain the free energy surface. We show that the new method proposed here is accurate, improves the conformational sampling, and achieves quick convergence in free energy estimates. We demonstrate this by computing the conformational free energy landscapes of solvated alanine tripeptide and Trp‐cage mini protein in explicit water. A new method is proposed for efficient sampling of conformational space of large soft matter systems. The method permits one to drive a conformational change along a collective variable (CV) in a controlled fashion and exhaustive sampling of orthogonal coordinates through accelerating global motions (without specifying any CVs) and biased sampling of a priori chosen CVs. The method is shown to be very accurate and quite efficient for problems such as protein folding.}},

By introducing a potential surface scaled with temperature, the sampling over the configuration space of interest (e.g., the solvated biomolecule) is selectively enhanced but the rest of the system (e.g., the solvent) stays largely unperturbed. The applications of this method to biomolecular systems allow highly efficient sampling over both energy and configuration spaces of interest. Comparing to the popular and powerful replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), the method presented in this paper is significantly more efficient in yielding relevant thermodynamics quantities (such as the potential of mean force for biomolecular conformational changes in aqueous solutions). It is more important that SITS but not REMD yielded results that are consistent with the traditional umbrella sampling free energy calculations when explicit solvent model is used since SITS avoids the sampling of the irrelevant phase space (such as the boiling water at high temperatures).}},

Similarly to basic metadynamics, it uses a bias potential in the form of hills summed over the simulation. Each system adds a big hill to its "own" bias potential and smaller hills to bias potentials of other systems, hence, each system enhances sampling of other systems. This makes it possible to achieve either faster reaching of the stationary point or higher accuracy of the calculated free energy surfaces. This should be efficient in modeling of series of chemically similar systems, for example, in computational drug screening by metadynamics. The method was tested on model energy surfaces, alanine dipeptide modeled in different force fields and monosaccharides of D-hexopyranose series.}},

  abstract = {{Considerable evidence has accumulated in recent years suggesting that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) associate in the plasma membrane to form homo- and/or heteromers. Nevertheless, the stoichiometry, fraction and lifetime of such receptor complexes in living cells remain topics of intense debate. Motivated by experimental data suggesting differing stabilities for homomers of the cognate human β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, we have carried out approximately 160 microseconds of biased molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the dimerization free energy of crystal structure-based models of these receptors, interacting at two interfaces that have often been implicated in GPCR association under physiological conditions. Specifically, results are presented for simulations of coarse-grained (MARTINI-based) and atomistic representations of each receptor, in homodimeric configurations with either transmembrane helices TM1/H8 or TM4/3 at the interface, in an explicit lipid bilayer. Our results support a definite contribution to the relative stability of GPCR dimers from both interface sequence and configuration. We conclude that β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor homodimers with TM1/H8 at the interface are more stable than those involving TM4/3, and that this might be reconciled with experimental studies by considering a model of oligomerization in which more stable TM1 homodimers diffuse through the membrane, transiently interacting with other protomers at interfaces involving other TM helices.}},

We review here the approaches that can be used to combine MD and experiment under the guidance of the maximum entropy principle. We mostly focus on methods based on Lagrangian multipliers, either implemented as reweighting of existing simulations or through an on-the-fly optimization. We discuss how errors in the experimental data can be modeled and accounted for. Finally, we use simple model systems to illustrate the typical difficulties arising when applying these methods.}},

  abstract    = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

The dominant local minima on the potential energy surface (PES) are partially exalted by accumulating history-dependent potentials as in metadynamics, and the sampling over the entire PES is further enhanced by ITS/SITS. With this hybrid method, the simulated system can be rapidly driven across the dominant barrier along selected collective coordinates. Then, ITS/SITS ensures a fast convergence of the sampling over the entire PES and an efficient calculation of the overall thermodynamic properties of the simulation system. To test the accuracy and efficiency of this method, we first benchmarked this method in the calculation of ϕ − ψ distribution of alanine dipeptide in explicit solvent. We further applied it to examine the design of template molecules for aromatic meta-C—H activation in solutions and investigate solution conformations of the nonapeptide Bradykinin involving slow cis-transisomerizations of three proline residues.}},

  abstract = {{An ad-hoc, yet widely adopted approach to investigate complex molecular objects in motion using importance-sampling schemes involves two steps, namely (i) mapping the multidimensional free-energy landscape that characterizes the movements in the molecular object at hand and (ii) finding the most probable transition path connecting basins of the free-energy hyperplane. To achieve this goal, we turn to an importance-sampling algorithm, coined well-tempered metadynamics-extended adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF), aimed at mapping rugged free-energy landscapes, combined with a path-searching algorithm, which we call multidimensional lowest energy (MULE), to identify the underlying minimum free-energy pathway in the collective-variable space of interest. First, the well-tempered feature of the importance-sampling scheme confers to the latter an asymptotic convergence, while the overall algorithm inherits the advantage of high sampling efficiency of its predecessor, meta-eABF, making its performance less sensitive to user-defined parameters. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in MULE is able to identify with utmost efficiency a pathway that satisfies minimum free energy of activation among all the possible routes in the multidimensional free-energy landscape. Numerical simulations of three molecular assemblies indicate that association of WTM-eABF and MULE constitutes a reliable, efficient and robust approach for exploring coupled movements in complex molecular objects. On account of its ease of use and intrinsic performance, we expect WTM-eABF and MULE to become a tool of choice for both experts and nonexperts interested in the thermodynamics and the kinetics of processes relevant to chemistry and biology.}},

Free-energy calculations, which provide the energy value of the ligand–protein binding complex, are essential for resolving the binding mode of the ligand. The accuracy of free-energy calculation methods is counteracted by their poor user-friendliness, which hampers their broad application. Here we present the Funnel-Metadynamics Advanced Protocol (FMAP), which is a flexible and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)-based protocol to perform funnel metadynamics, a binding free-energy method that employs a funnel-shape restraint potential to reveal the ligand binding mode and accurately calculate the absolute ligand–protein binding free energy. FMAP guides the user through all phases of the free-energy calculation process, from preparation of the input files, to production simulation, to analysis of the results. FMAP delivers the ligand binding mode and the absolute protein–ligand binding free energy as outputs. Alternative binding modes and the role of waters are also elucidated, providing a detailed description of the ligand binding mechanism. The entire protocol on the paradigmatic system benzamidine–trypsin, composed of \textbackslashtextasciitilde105 k atoms, took \textbackslashtextasciitilde2.8 d using the Cray XC50 piz Daint cluster at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre. Here the authors describe a GUI-based protocol called FMAP for using funnel metadynamics to calculate the absolute binding free energy of a ligand to its molecular target and predict the ligand binding mode and mechanism.}},

Here, we propose a method to calculate phase diagrams involving liquid and solid phases by the reversible transformation of the liquid and the solid. To this end, we introduce an order parameter that breaks the rotational symmetry and we leverage our recently introduced method to sample the multithermal-multibaric ensemble. In this way, in a single molecular dynamics simulation, we are able to compute the liquid-solid coexistence line for entire regions of the temperature and pressure phase diagram. We apply our approach to the bcc-liquid phase diagram of sodium and the fcc-bcc-liquid phase diagram of aluminum.}},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

The biases fall into two basic classes, each having distinct attributes and levels of complexity. The vantage point from which the biases are discussed has only emerged in the last couple of years, and allows for a unified treatment of all the biases.

  abstract  = {Simulating the conformational dynamics of biomolecules is extremely difficult due to the rugged nature of their free energy landscapes and multiple long-lived, or metastable, states. Generalized ensemble (GE) algorithms, which have become popular in recent years, attempt to facilitate crossing between states at low temperatures by inducing a random walk in temperature space. Enthalpic barriers may be crossed more easily at high temperatures; however, entropic barriers will become more significant. This poses a problem because the dominant barriers to conformational change are entropic for many biological systems, such as the short RNA hairpin studied here. We present a new efficient algorithm for conformational sampling, called the adaptive seeding method (ASM), which uses nonequilibrium GE simulations to identify the metastable states, and seeds short simulations at constant temperature from each of them to quantitatively determine their equilibrium populations. Thus, the ASM takes advantage of the broad sampling possible with GE algorithms but generally crosses entropic barriers more efficiently during the seeding simulations at low temperature. We show that only local equilibrium is necessary for ASM, so very short seeding simulations may be used. Moreover, the ASM may be used to recover equilibrium properties from existing datasets that failed to converge, and is well suited to running on modern computer clusters.},

  abstract = {{Temperature accelerated sliced sampling (TASS) is an efficient method to compute high dimensional free energy landscapes. The original TASS method employs the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) which is an iterative post‐processing to reweight and stitch high dimensional probability distributions in sliced windows that are obtained in the presence of restraining biases. The WHAM necessitates that TASS windows lie close to each other for proper overlap of distributions and span the collective variable space of interest. On the other hand, increase in number of TASS windows implies more number of simulations, and thus it affects the efficiency of the method. To overcome this problem, we propose herein a new mean‐force (MF) based reweighting scheme called TASS‐MF, which enables accurate computation with a fewer number of windows devoid of the WHAM post‐processing. Application of the technique is demonstrated for alanine di‐ and tripeptides in vacuo to compute their two‐ and four‐dimensional free energy landscapes, the latter of which is formidable in conventional umbrella sampling and metadynamics. The landscapes are computed within a kcal mol−1 accuracy, ensuring a safe usage for broad applications in computational chemistry. Temperature accelerated sliced sampling (TASS) is a powerful method for the exploration and computation of high‐dimensional free energy landscapes (HDFEL). Here we introduce a new method for the reconstruction of HDFEL for TASS. With this method, weighted histogram analysis method can be completely avoided and TASS can be performed with less number of windows without compromising on the accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the efficiency of the TASS approach.}},

We present a novel approach, called targeted adversarial learning optimized sampling (TALOS), to modify the potential energy surface in order to drive the system to a user-defined target distribution where the free-energy barrier is lowered. Combining statistical mechanics and generative learning, TALOS formulates a competing game between a sampling engine and a virtual discriminator, enables unsupervised construction of bias potentials, and seeks for an optimal transport plan that transforms the system into a target. Through multiple experiments, we show that on-the-fly training of TALOS benefits from the state-of-art optimization techniques in deep learning and thus is efficient, robust, and interpretable. TALOS is also closely connected to the actor-critic reinforcement learning and hence leads to a new way of flexibly manipulating the many-body Hamiltonian systems.}},

The shape of the adaptive biasing potential is adjusted on the fly by sampling over the visited states. As the top of the barrier is approached, the biasing potentials become wider. This decreases the problem of trapping the system in the niches, introduced by the addition of Gaussians of fixed height in metadynamics.

By constructing a bias potential in this reduced space, one is then able to sample efficiently and reconstruct the free energy landscape. In methods such as metadynamics, the quality of these collective variables plays a key role in convergence efficiency. Unfortunately in many systems of interest it is not possible to identify an optimal collective variable, and one must deal with the nonideal situation of a system in which some slow modes are not accelerated. We propose a two-step approach in which, by taking into account the residual multiscale nature of the problem, one is able to significantly speed up convergence. To do so, we combine an exploratory metadynamics run with an optimization of the free energy difference between metastable states, based on the recently proposed variationally enhanced sampling method. This new method is well parallelizable and is especially suited for complex systems, because of its simplicity and clear underlying physical picture.}},

Asymptotically the free-energy surface is proportional to the bias deposited. Here, we consider the possibility of using Gaussians whose variance is adjusted on the fly to the local properties of the free-energy surface. We suggest two different prescriptions: one is based on the local diffusivity and the other on the local geometrical properties. We further examine the problem of extracting the free-energy surface when using adaptive Gaussians. We show that the standard relation between the bias and the free energy does not hold. In the limit of narrow Gaussians an explicit correction can be evaluated. In the general case, we propose to use instead a relation between bias and free energy borrowed from umbrella sampling. This relation holds for all kinds of incrementally deposited bias. We illustrate on the case of alanine dipeptide the advantage of using adaptive Gaussians in conjunction with the new free-energy estimator both in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence.}},

The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between "particles" and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split, and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled. The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model of docking-type diffusion-limited reactions and yields reaction rate constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation, but at a fraction of the CPU time (10(-4) to 10(-3), depending on the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models, can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest to the biophysics community.},

This chapter specifically focuses on the metadynamics family of methods, which achieves enhanced sampling through the introduction of a history-dependent bias potential that is based on one or more slow degrees of freedom, called collective variables.

  abstract  = {One of the major challenges in atomistic simulations of proteins is efficient sampling of pathways associated with rare conformational transitions. Recent developments in statistical methods for computation of direct evolutionary couplings between amino acids within and across polypeptide chains have allowed for inference of native residue contacts, informing accurate prediction of protein folds and multimeric structures. In this study, we assess the use of distances between evolutionarily coupled residues as natural choices for reaction coordinates which can be incorporated into Markov state model-based adaptive sampling schemes and potentially used to predict not only functional conformations but also pathways of conformational change, protein folding, and protein-protein association. We demonstrate the utility of evolutionary couplings in sampling and predicting activation pathways of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), folding of the FiP35 WW domain, and dimerization of the E. coli molybdopterin synthase subunits. We find that the time required for β2-AR activation and folding of the WW domain are greatly diminished using evolutionary couplings-guided adaptive sampling. Additionally, we were able to identify putative molybdopterin synthase association pathways and near-crystal structure complexes from protein-protein association simulations.},

The Aβ21-30 peptide fragment is a decapeptide fragment of the complete Aβ42 peptide which is a hypothesized cause of Alzheimer's disease via amyloid fibrillogenesis. Aβ21-30 is investigated here with a combination of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics simulations with experiment directed simulation (EDS). EDS is a maximum entropy biasing method that augments a molecular dynamics simulation with experimental data (NMR chemical shifts) to improve agreement with experiments and thus accuracy. EDS molecular dynamics shows that the Aβ21-30 monomer has a β turn stabilized by the following interactions: S26-K28, D23-S26, and D23-K28. NMR, total correlation spectroscopy, and rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments provide independent agreement. Subsequent two- and four-monomer EDS simulations show aggregation. Diffusion coefficients calculated from molecular simulation also agreed with experimentally measured values only after using EDS, providing independent assessment of accuracy. This work demonstrates how accuracy can be improved by directly using experimental data in molecular dynamics of complex processes like self-assembly.}},

  abstract  = {Direct simulations explore the dynamics of physical systems at their natural pace. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (e.g., of macromolecular folding) extensively revisit typical configurations until rare and interesting transition events occur. Biasing the simulator away from regions already explored can, therefore, drastically accelerate the discovery of features. We propose an enhanced sampling simulation framework, where MD and machine learning adaptively bootstrap each other. Machine learning guides the search for important configurations by processing information from previous explorations. This search proceeds iteratively in an algorithmically orchestrated fashion without advance knowledge of suitable collective variables. Applied to a molecular sensor of lipid saturation in membranes, a helix dissociation pathway not seen in millisecond simulations is discovered at the second iteration.We describe and implement a computer-assisted approach for accelerating the exploration of uncharted effective free-energy surfaces (FESs). More generally, the aim is the extraction of coarse-grained, macroscopic information from stochastic or atomistic simulations, such as molecular dynamics (MD). The approach functionally links the MD simulator with nonlinear manifold learning techniques. The added value comes from biasing the simulator toward unexplored phase-space regions by exploiting the smoothness of the gradually revealed intrinsic low-dimensional geometry of the FES.},

However, considerable conformational transitions take place during a simulation only accidentally or at exceptionally high temperatures far from the range of experimental conditions. Targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) is a method to induce a conformational change to a known target structure at ordinary temperature by applying a time-dependent, purely geometrical constraint. The transition is enforced independently of the height of energy barriers, while the dynamics of the molecule is only minimally influenced by the constraint. Simulations of decaalanine and insulin show the ability of the method to explore the configurational space for pathways accessible at a given temperature. The transitions studied at insulin comprise unfolding of an alpha-helical portion and, in the reverse direction, refolding from an extended conformation. A possible application of TMD is the search for energy barriers and stable intermediates from rather local changes up to protein denaturation.},

  abstract = {{Metadynamics (MTD) is one of the most effective methods for calculating the free energy surface and finding rare events. Nevertheless, numerous studies using MTD have been carried out using 3D or lower dimensional collective variables (CVs), as higher dimensional CVs require costly computational resources and the obtained results are too complex to understand the important events. The latter issue can be conveniently solved by utilizing the free energy reaction network (FERN), which is a graph structure consisting of edges of minimum free energy paths (MFEPs), nodes of equation (EQ) points, and transition state (TS) points. In the present article, a new method for exploring FERNs on high-dimensional CVs using MTD and the scaled hypersphere search (SHS) method is described. A test calculation based on the MTD-SHS simulation of met-enkephalin in explicit water with 7 CVs was conducted. As a result, 889 EQ points and 1805 TS points were found. The MTD-SHS approach can find MFEPs exhaustively; therefore, the FERNs can be estimated without any a priori knowledge of the EQ and TS points.}},

While many such methods are able to obtain sufficient sampling in order to draw the free energy, the transition states are often sparsely sampled. We propose an approach based on the Variationally Enhanced Sampling Method to enhance sampling in the transition region. To this effect, we introduce a dynamic target distribution which uses the derivative of the instantaneous free energy surface to locate the transition regions on the fly and modulate the probability of sampling different regions. Finally, we exemplify the effectiveness of this approach in enriching the number of configurations in the transition state region in the cases of a chemical reaction and of a nucleation process.}},

The method biases a conventional MD simulation to sample a molecular ensemble that is consistent with one or more probability distributions known a priori, e.g., experimental intramolecular distance distributions obtained by double electron-electron resonance or other spectroscopic techniques. To this end, EBMetaD adds an adaptive biasing potential throughout the simulation that discourages sampling of configurations inconsistent with the target probability distributions. The bias introduced is the minimum necessary to fulfill the target distributions, i.e., EBMetaD satisfies the maximum-entropy principle. Unlike other methods, EBMetaD does not require multiple simulation replicas or the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, and is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in practice. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method for a model system as well as for spin-labeled T4 lysozyme in explicit water, and show how EBMetaD reproduces three double electron-electron resonance distance distributions concurrently within a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time. EBMetaD is integrated in the open-source PLUMED plug-in (www.plumed-code.org), and can be therefore readily used with multiple MD engines.}},

We conclude that the source of the saturation of the error is due to the decreasing variations of the refinement parameter. To overcome this limitation, we present an analytical treatment in which the refinement parameter is scaled down as a power law instead of exponentially. An extension of the analysis to the N-fold way variation of the method is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background
For biomacromolecules or their assemblies, experimental knowledge is often restricted to specific states. Ambiguity pervades simulations of these complex systems because there is no prior knowledge of relevant phase space domains, and sampling recurrence is difficult to achieve. In molecular dynamics methods, ruggedness of the free energy surface exacerbates this problem by slowing down the unbiased exploration of phase space. Sampling is inefficient if dwell times in metastable states are large.
Methods
We suggest a heuristic algorithm to terminate and reseed trajectories run in multiple copies in parallel. It uses a recent method to order snapshots, which provides notions of “interesting” and “unique” for individual simulations. We define criteria to guide the reseeding of runs from more “interesting” points if they sample overlapping regions of phase space.
Results
Using a pedagogical example and an α-helical peptide, the approach is demonstrated to amplify the rate of exploration of phase space and to discover metastable states not found by conventional sampling schemes. Evidence is provided that accurate kinetics and pathways can be extracted from the simulations.
Conclusions
The method, termed PIGS for Progress Index Guided Sampling, proceeds in unsupervised fashion, is scalable, and benefits synergistically from larger numbers of replicas. Results confirm that the underlying ideas are appropriate and sufficient to enhance sampling.
General Significance
In molecular simulations, errors caused by not exploring relevant domains in phase space are always unquantifiable and can be arbitrarily large. Our protocol adds to the toolkit available to researchers in reducing these types of errors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled “Recent Developments of Molecular Dynamics.”},

  abstract = {{  Creating models that are consistent with experimental data is essential in molecular modeling. This is often done by iteratively tuning the molecular force field of a simulation to match experimental data. An alternative method is to bias a simulation, leading to a hybrid model composed of the original force field and biasing terms. We previously introduced such a method called experiment directed simulation (EDS). EDS minimally biases simulations to match average values. In this work, we introduce a new method called experiment directed metadynamics (EDM) that creates minimal biases for matching entire free energy surfaces such as radial distribution functions and phi/psi angle free energies. It is also possible with EDM to create a tunable mixture of the experimental data and free energy of the unbiased ensemble with explicit ratios. EDM can be proven to be convergent, and we also present proof, via a maximum entropy argument, that the final bias is minimal and unique. Examples of its use are given in the construction of ensembles that follow a desired free energy. The example systems studied include a Lennard-Jones fluid made to match a radial distribution function, an atomistic model augmented with bioinformatics data, and a three-component electrolyte solution where ab initio simulation data is used to improve a classical empirical model.}},

  abstract = {{Modeling a complex system is almost invariably a challenging task. The incorporation of experimental observations can be used to improve the quality of a model and thus to obtain better predictions about the behavior of the corresponding system. This approach, however, is affected by a variety of different errors, especially when a system simultaneously populates an ensemble of different states and experimental data are measured as averages over such states. To address this problem, we present a Bayesian inference method, called “metainference,” that is able to deal with errors in experimental measurements and with experimental measurements averaged over multiple states. To achieve this goal, metainference models a finite sample of the distribution of models using a replica approach, in the spirit of the replica-averaging modeling based on the maximum entropy principle. To illustrate the method, we present its application to a heterogeneous model system and to the determination of an ensemble of structures corresponding to the thermal fluctuations of a protein molecule. Metainference thus provides an approach to modeling complex systems with heterogeneous components and interconverting between different states by taking into account all possible sources of errors.}},

Introducing a bias potential as a function of an appropriately chosen set of collective variables can significantly accelerate the exploration of phase space, albeit at the price of distorting the distribution of microstates. Efficient reweighting to recover the unbiased distribution can be nontrivial when employing adaptive sampling techniques such as metadynamics, variationally enhanced sampling, or parallel bias metadynamics, in which the system evolves in a quasi-equilibrium manner under a time-dependent bias. We introduce an iterative unbiasing scheme that makes efficient use of all the trajectory data and that does not require the distribution to be evaluated on a grid. The method can thus be used even when the bias has a high dimensionality. We benchmark this approach against some of the existing schemes on model systems with different complexity and dimensionality.}},

  abstract  = {Modeling the dynamic nature of protein-ligand binding with atomistic simulations is one of the main challenges in computational biophysics, with important implications in the drug design process. Although in the past few years hardware and software advances have significantly revamped the use of molecular simulations, we still lack a fast and accurate ab initio description of the binding mechanism in complex systems, available only for up-to-date techniques and requiring several hours or days of heavy computation. Such delay is one of the main limiting factors for a larger penetration of protein dynamics modeling in the pharmaceutical industry. Here we present a game-changing technology, opening up the way for fast reliable simulations of protein dynamics by combining an adaptive reinforcement learning procedure with Monte Carlo sampling in the frame of modern multi-core computational resources. We show remarkable performance in mapping the protein-ligand energy landscape, being able to reproduce the full binding mechanism in less than half an hour, or the active site induced fit in less than 5 minutes. We exemplify our method by studying diverse complex targets, including nuclear hormone receptors and GPCRs, demonstrating the potential of using the new adaptive technique in screening and lead optimization studies.},

  abstract = {{To overcome the pseudoergodicity problem, conformational sampling can be accelerated via generalized ensemble methods, e.g., through the realization of random walks along prechosen collective variables, such as spatial order parameters, energy scaling parameters, or even system temperatures or pressures, etc. As usually observed, in generalized ensemble simulations, hidden barriers are likely to exist in the space perpendicular to the collective variable direction and these residual free energy barriers could greatly abolish the sampling efficiency. This sampling issue is particularly severe when the collective variable is defined in a low-dimension subset of the target system; then the "Hamiltonian lagging" problem, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the move of the collective variable, may be likely to occur. To overcome this problem in equilibrium conformational sampling, we adopted the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) strategy, which was originally developed in the context of free energy simulation [L. Zheng, M. Chen, and W. Yang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 20227 (2008)]. Thereby, generalized ensemble simulations can simultaneously escape both the explicit barriers along the collective variable direction and the hidden barriers that are strongly coupled with the collective variable move. As demonstrated in our model studies, the present OSRW based generalized ensemble treatments show improved sampling capability over the corresponding classical generalized ensemble treatments.}},

  abstract    = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N(')-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of drug binding and unbinding is assuming an increasingly crucial role in the long, costly process of bringing a new medicine to patients. For example, the time a drug spends in contact with its biological target is known as residence time (the inverse of the kinetic constant of the drug-target unbinding, 1/koff). Recent reports suggest that residence time could predict drug efficacy in vivo, perhaps even more effectively than conventional thermodynamic parameters (free energy, enthalpy, entropy). There are many experimental and computational methods for predicting drug-target residence time at an early stage of drug discovery programs. Here, we review and discuss the methodological approaches to estimating drug binding kinetics and residence time. We first introduce the theoretical background of drug binding kinetics from a physicochemical standpoint. We then analyze the recent literature in the field, starting from the experimental methodologies and applications thereof and moving to theoretical and computational approaches to the kinetics of drug binding and unbinding. We acknowledge the central role of molecular dynamics and related methods, which comprise a great number of the computational methods and applications reviewed here. However, we also consider kinetic Monte Carlo. We conclude with the outlook that drug (un)binding kinetics may soon become a go/no go step in the discovery and development of new medicines.},

  abstract             = {Proper use of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm in free-energy calculations needs certain prerequisites to be met, namely, that the Jacobian for the metric transformation and its first derivative be available and the coarse variables be independent and fully decoupled from any holonomic constraint or geometric restraint, thereby limiting singularly the field of application of the approach. The extended ABF (eABF) algorithm circumvents these intrinsic limitations by applying the time-dependent bias onto a fictitious particle coupled to the coarse variable of interest by means of a stiff spring. However, with the current implementation of eABF in the popular molecular dynamics engine NAMD, a trajectory-based post-treatment is necessary to derive the underlying free-energy change. Usually, such a posthoc analysis leads to a decrease in the reliability of the free-energy estimates due to the inevitable loss of information, as well as to a drop in efficiency, which stems from substantial read-write accesses to file systems. We have developed a user-friendly, on-the-fly code for performing eABF simulations within NAMD. In the present contribution, this code is probed in eight illustrative examples. The performance of the algorithm is compared with traditional ABF, on the one hand, and the original eABF implementation combined with a posthoc analysis, on the other hand. Our results indicate that the on-the-fly eABF algorithm (i) supplies the correct free-energy landscape in those critical cases where the coarse variables at play are coupled to either each other or to geometric restraints or holonomic constraints, (ii) greatly improves the reliability of the free-energy change, compared to the outcome of a posthoc analysis, and (iii) represents a negligible additional computational effort compared to regular ABF. Moreover, in the proposed implementation, guidelines for choosing two parameters of the eABF algorithm, namely the stiffness of the spring and the mass of the fictitious particles, are proposed. The present on-the-fly eABF implementation can be viewed as the second generation of the ABF algorithm, expected to be widely utilized in the theoretical investigation of recognition and association phenomena relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {{Metadynamics (MTD) is a very powerful technique to sample high-dimensional free energy landscapes, and due to its self-guiding property, the method has been successful in studying complex reactions and conformational changes. MTD sampling is based on filling the free energy basins by biasing potentials and thus for cases with flat, broad, and unbound free energy wells, the computational time to sample them becomes very large. To alleviate this problem, we combine the standard Umbrella Sampling (US) technique with MTD to sample orthogonal collective variables (CVs) in a simultaneous way. Within this scheme, we construct the equilibrium distribution of CVs from biased distributions obtained from independent MTD simulations with umbrella potentials. Reweighting is carried out by a procedure that combines US reweighting and Tiwary–Parrinello MTD reweighting within the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). The approach is ideal for a controlled sampling of a CV in a MTD simulation, making it computationally efficient in sampling flat, broad, and unbound free energy surfaces. This technique also allows for a distributed sampling of a high-dimensional free energy surface, further increasing the computational efficiency in sampling. We demonstrate the application of this technique in sampling high-dimensional surface for various chemical reactions using ab initio and QM/MM hybrid molecular dynamics simulations. Further, to carry out MTD bias reweighting for computing forward reaction barriers in ab initio or QM/MM simulations, we propose a computationally affordable approach that does not require recrossing trajectories. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

This aspect is particularly evident for disordered proteins, which constitute perhaps one-third of the human proteome. Therefore, structural ensembles often offer more useful representations of proteins than individual conformations. Here, we describe how the well-established principles of protein structure determination should be extended to the case of protein structural ensembles determination. These principles concern primarily how to deal with conformationally heterogeneous states, and with experimental measurements that are averaged over such states and affected by a variety of errors. We first review the growing literature of recent methods that combine experimental and computational information to model structural ensembles, highlighting their similarities and differences. We then address some conceptual problems in the determination of structural ensembles and define future goals towards the establishment of objective criteria for the comparison, validation, visualization and dissemination of such ensembles.}},

An important caveat in pursuing this goal is to avoid corrupting the resulting model with spurious and arbitrary biases. While the problem of biasing thermodynamic ensembles can be formulated rigorously using the maximum entropy method introduced by Jaynes, the approach can be cumbersome in practical applications with the need to determine multiple unknown coefficients iteratively. A popular alternative strategy to incorporate the information from experiments is to rely on restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. However, the fundamental validity of this computational strategy remains in question. Here, it is demonstrated that the statistical distribution produced by restrained-ensemble simulations is formally consistent with the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. This clarifies the underlying conditions under which restrained-ensemble simulations will yield results that are consistent with the maximum entropy method.}},

Further, user-specified parameters are in general non-intuitive yet significantly affect the convergence rate and accuracy of the free energy estimate. Here we propose a novel method, wherein artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop an adaptive biasing potential which learns free energy landscapes. We demonstrate that this method is capable of rapidly adapting to complex free energy landscapes and is not prone to boundary or oscillation problems. The method is made robust to hyperparameters and overfitting through Bayesian regularization which penalizes network weights and auto-regulates the number of effective parameters in the network. ANN sampling represents a promising innovative approach which can resolve complex free energy landscapes in less time than conventional approaches while requiring minimal user input.}},

WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages. This article reviews the theoretical basis of WE and goes on to describe successful applications to a number of complex biological processes—protein conformational transitions, (un)binding, and assembly processes, as well as cell-scale processes in systems biology.

  abstract = {{A statistical mechanics description of complex molecular systems involves the determination of ensembles of conformations that represent their Boltzmann distributions. The observable properties of these systems can be then predicted by calculating averages over such ensembles. In principle, given accurate energy functions and efficient sampling methods, these ensembles can be generated by molecular dynamics simulations. In practice, however, often the energy functions are known only approximately and the sampling can be carried out only in a limited manner. We describe here a method that enables to increase simultaneously both the quality of the energy functions and of the extent of the sampling in a system-dependent manner. The method is based on the incorporation of experimental data as replica-averaged structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations and exploits the metadynamics framework to enhance the sampling. The application to the case of α-conotoxin SI, a 13-residue peptide that has been characterized extensively by experimental measurements, shows that the approach that we describe enables accurate free energy landscapes to be generated. The analysis of these landscapes indicates the presence of a low population state in equilibrium with the native state in which the only aromatic residue of α-conotoxin SI is exposed to the solvent, which is a feature that may predispose the peptide to interact with its partners.}},

  abstract    = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

Because complex systems often undergo nontrivial structural transition during state switching, achieving efficient free-energy calculation can be challenging. As identified earlier, the “Hamiltonian” lagging, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby, the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, (i) it allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately predicting the pKa value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the interior of the V66E staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and (ii) it allows us to gain superior efficiency over the metadynamics algorithm.}},

  abstract = {{Study of complex activated molecular transitions by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can be a daunting task, especially when little knowledge is available on the reaction coordinate describing the mechanism of the process. Here, we assess the path-metadynamics enhanced sampling approach in combination with force field and ab initio [density functional theory (DFT)] MD simulations of conformational and chemical transitions that require three or more collective variables (CVs) to describe the processes. We show that the method efficiently localizes the average transition path of each process and simultaneously obtains the free energy profile along the path. The new multiple-walker implementation greatly speeds-up the calculation, with an almost trivial scaling of the number of parallel replicas. Increasing the dimensionality by expanding the set of CVs leads to a less than linear increase in the computational cost, as shown by applying the method to a conformational change in increasingly longer polyproline peptides. Combined with DFT-MD to model acid (de-)protonation in explicit water solvent, the transition path and associated free energy profile were obtained in less than 100 ps of simulation. A final application to hydrogen fuel production catalyzed by a hydrogenase enzyme showcases the unique mechanistic insight and chemical understanding that can be obtained from the average transition path.}},

This algorithm shaves the free-energy barriers and floods valleys by incorporating a history-dependent potential term in the extended adaptive biasing force (eABF) framework. Numerical applications on both toy models and nontrivial examples indicate that meta-eABF explores the free-energy surface significantly faster than either eABF or metadynamics (MtD) alone, without the need to stratify the reaction pathway. In some favorable cases, meta-eABF can be as much as five times faster than other importance-sampling algorithms. Many of the shortcomings inherent to eABF and MtD, like kinetic trapping in regions of configurational space already adequately sampled, the requirement of prior knowledge of the free-energy landscape to set up the simulation, are readily eliminated in meta-eABF. Meta-eABF, therefore, represents an appealing solution for a broad range of applications, especially when both eABF and MtD fail to achieve the desired result.}},

We then show that the free energy landscape reconstructed from reweighted data can be more accurate than the negative bias potential depending on the reweighting technique, the stage of the simulation, and the adoption of well-tempered or standard metadynamics. While none of the tested reweighting techniques from the literature provides the most accurate results in all the analyzed situations, the one proposed here, in addition to helping simplifying the reweighting procedure, converges quickly and precisely to the underlying free energy surface in all the considered cases, thus allowing for an efficient use of limited simulation data.}},

We present several new algorithms and implementation techniques that significantly accelerate parallel MD simulations compared with current state-of-the-art codes. These include a novel parallel decomposition method and message-passing techniques that reduce communication requirements, as well as novel communication primitives that further reduce communication time. We have also developed numerical techniques that maintain high accuracy while using single precision computation in order to exploit processor-level vector instructions. These methods are embodied in a newly developed MD code called Desmond that achieves unprecedented simulation throughput and parallel scalability on commodity clusters. Our results suggest that Desmond's parallel performance substantially surpasses that of any previously described code. For example, on a standard benchmark, Desmond's performance on a conventional Opteron cluster with 2K processors slightly exceeded the reported performance of IBM's Blue Gene/L machine with 32K processors running its Blue Matter MD code}},

  abstract = {Consider the two problems of simulating observations and estimating expectations and normalizing constants for multiple distributions. First, we present a self-adjusted mixture sampling method, which accommodates both adaptive serial tempering and a generalized Wang–Landau algorithm. The set of distributions are combined into a labeled mixture, with the mixture weights depending on the initial estimates of log normalizing constants (or free energies). Then, observations are generated by Markov transitions, and free energy estimates are adjusted online by stochastic approximation. We propose two stochastic approximation schemes by Rao–Blackwellization of the scheme commonly used, and derive the optimal choice of a gain matrix, resulting in the minimum asymptotic variance for free energy estimation, in a simple and feasible form. Second, we develop an offline method, locally weighted histogram analysis, for estimating free energies and expectations, using all the simulated data from multiple distributions by either self-adjusted mixture sampling or other sampling algorithms. This method can be computationally much faster, with little sacrifice of statistical efficiency, than a global method currently used, especially when a large number of distributions are involved. We provide both theoretical results and numerical studies to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.},

We illustrate the method by applying it to obtain free energy weights for each of the 240 states in a simulation of host–guest ligand binding containing ∼3.5 × 10^7 data elements collected from 16 parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations, performed at 15 temperatures.

We compare the FEP/REST results with traditional FEP/MD (molecular dynamics)results and MM/GBSA (molecular mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area model) results and examine why FEP/REST performed notably better than these other methods, as well as why certain ligand mutations lead to large increases of the binding affinity while others do not.

Inter-process communication and coordination requirements have historically discouraged the deployment of replica exchange on distributed and heterogeneous resources. Here we describe the architecture of a software (named ASyncRE) for performing asynchronous replica exchange molecular simulations on volunteered computing grids and heterogeneous high performance clusters. The asynchronous replica exchange algorithm on which the software is based avoids centralized synchronization steps and the need for direct communication between remote processes. It allows molecular dynamics threads to progress at different rates and enables parameter exchanges among arbitrary sets of replicas independently from other replicas. ASyncRE is written in Python following a modular design conducive to extensions to various replica exchange schemes and molecular dynamics engines. Applications of the software for the modeling of association equilibria of supramolecular and macromolecular complexes on BOINC campus computational grids and on the CPU/MIC heterogeneous hardware of the XSEDE Stampede supercomputer are illustrated. They show the ability of ASyncRE to utilize large grids of desktop computers running the Windows, MacOS, and/or Linux operating systems as well as collections of high performance heterogeneous hardware devices.},

The method, which we call GaREUS (Gaussian accelerated replica-exchange umbrella sampling), enhances the sampling more efficiently than REUS or GaMD, while the computational resource for GaREUS is the same as that required for REUS. The two-step reweighting procedure using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method and the cumulant expansion for the exponential average is applied to the simulation trajectories for obtaining the unbiased free-energy landscapes. We apply GaREUS to the calculations of free-energy landscapes for three different cases: conformational equilibria of N-glycan, folding of chignolin, and conformational change of adenyl kinase. We show that GaREUS speeds up the convergences of free-energy calculations using the same amount of computational resources as REUS. The free-energy landscapes reweighted from the trajectories of GaREUS agree with previously reported ones. GaREUS is applicable to free-energy calculations of various biomolecular dynamics and functions with reasonable computational costs.},

Understanding the molecular mechanism of protein aggregation is essential for therapy development. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been shown as powerful tools to study protein aggregation. However, conventional MD simulations can hardly sample the whole conformational space of complex protein systems within acceptable simulation time as it can be easily trapped in local minimum-energy states. Many enhanced sampling methods have been developed. Among these, the replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method has gained great popularity. By combining MD simulation with the Monte Carlo algorithm, the REMD method is capable of overcoming high energy-barriers easily and of sampling sufficiently the conformational space of proteins. In this chapter, we present a brief introduction to REMD method and a practical application protocol with a case study of the dimerization of the 11–25 fragment of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP(11–25)), using the GROMACS software. We also provide solutions to problems that are often encountered in practical use, and provide some useful scripts/commands from our research that can be easily adapted to other systems.},

First, we perform a study measuring the effect of exchange attempt frequency in explicit solvent simulations including thousands of atoms. This shows, consistent with the previous assertion, that high exchange attempt frequency allows an optimal rate of exploration of configurational space. Second, we present an explanation of many theoretical and technical pitfalls when implementing replica exchange that cause “improper” exchanges resulting in erroneous data, exacerbated by high exchange attempt frequency.},

  abstract  = {Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) is a popular method to accelerate conformational sampling of complex molecular systems. The idea is to run several replicas of the system in parallel at different temperatures that are swapped periodically. These swaps are typically attempted every few MD steps and accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis–Hastings criterion. This guarantees that the joint distribution of the composite system of replicas is the normalized sum of the symmetrized product of the canonical distributions of these replicas at the different temperatures. Here we propose a different implementation of REMD in which (i) the swaps obey a continuous-time Markov jump process implemented via Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which also samples exactly the aforementioned joint distribution and has the advantage of being rejection free, and (ii) this REMD-SSA is combined with the heterogeneous multiscale method to accelerate the rate of the swaps and reach the so-called infinite-swap limit that is known to optimize sampling efficiency. The method is easy to implement and can be trivially parallelized. Here we illustrate its accuracy and efficiency on the examples of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and C-terminal β-hairpin of protein G in explicit solvent. In this latter example, our results indicate that the landscape of the protein is a triple funnel with two folded structures and one misfolded structure that are stabilized by H-bonds.},

  abstract = {Replica exchange molecular dynamics is a multicanonical simulation technique commonly used to enhance the sampling of solvated biomolecules on rugged free energy landscapes. While replica exchange is relatively easy to implement, there are many unanswered questions about how to use this technique most efficiently, especially because it is frequently the case in practice that replica exchange simulations are not fully converged. A replica exchange cycle consists of a series of molecular dynamics steps of a set of replicas moving under different Hamiltonians or at different thermodynamic states followed by one or more replica exchange attempts to swap replicas among the different states. How the replica exchange cycle is constructed affects how rapidly the system equilibrates. We have constructed a Markov state model of replica exchange (MSMRE) using long molecular dynamics simulations of a host–guest binding system as an example, in order to study how different implementations of the replica exchange cycle can affect the sampling efficiency. We analyze how the number of replica exchange attempts per cycle, the number of MD steps per cycle, and the interaction between the two parameters affects the largest implied time scale of the MSMRE simulation. The infinite swapping limit is an important concept in replica exchange. We show how to estimate the infinite swapping limit from the diagonal elements of the exchange transition matrix constructed from MSMRE “simulations of simulations” as well as from relatively short runs of the actual replica exchange simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a formalism of the transition matrix Monte Carlo method. A stochastic matrix in the space of energy can be estimated from Monte Carlo simulation. This matrix is used to compute the density of states, as well as to construct multi-canonical and equal-hit algorithms. We discuss the performance of the methods. The results are compared with single histogram method, multi-canonical method, and other methods. In many aspects, the present method is an improvement over the previous methods.},
